# Allina<sup>(v)</sup>

> Vanilla beans for simple component-able frontend

Allina.v stands for vanilla backwards - just small vanilla code to enhance your simple projects/prototyping. It is ==not intended== to be replaced by or better than other modern frontend frameworks! As your project grows, consider evolving to one of those.

> Please note this is study material as of now.
